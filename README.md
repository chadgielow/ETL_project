# ETL_project
ETL assignment: Extract, Transform &amp; Load

Requirements:

    Source: Both of the CSV files that we are using for the project are from Kaggle.com
    Transformation: One of the CSV files was too large for GITHUB so we chopped it down in a JupyterNotebook and we were able to then load the file to GITHUB so everyone could access it. There was also a need to update column names so we did that in Jupyter Notebook.
    Production: For the Load phase of the project we are creating a Relational SQL Database. 
    Final Tables: 2 Tables: Used Cars & New Cars

Project Report:

    EXTRACT: CSV files
    TRANSFORM: Jupyter Notebooks 
    LOAD: SQL file & ERD image
